<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>"Building Scalable Web Applications with Next.js and React" is a comprehensive guide that explores the process of building scalable and performant web applications using the Next.js framework and React library. This repository focuses specifically on Chapter 5, where we delve into the optimization techniques for Next.js applications.</p>

<p>The code examples and resources provided here serve as a companion to the book, enabling you to follow along and experiment with the concepts discussed in Chapter 5. You will find code snippets, demo projects, and additional materials to support your learning and implementation of Next.js optimizations.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>To get started with the code examples in this repository, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/OrangeAVA/Building-Scalable-Web-Applications-with-Next.js-and-React.git
</code></pre>

<ol start="2">
  <li>Navigate to the relevant directory for Chapter 5 optimizations:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>cd Building-Scalable-Web-Applications-with-Next.js-and-React/Chapter-5-Optimizing-Next.js-Applications/
</code></pre>

<ol start="3">
  <li>Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>npm install
</code></pre>

<ol start="4">
  <li>Once the dependencies are installed, you can explore the code examples, modify them, and experiment with the optimization techniques described in the book.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>The examples in this repository cover a range of Next.js optimization techniques discussed in Chapter 5. Each example is contained within its own directory and includes code files, configuration files, and additional resources.</p>

<p>Feel free to explore the examples, examine the code, and run them in your local development environment. You can use these examples as a reference to understand and implement the optimization techniques in your own Next.js projects.</p>
